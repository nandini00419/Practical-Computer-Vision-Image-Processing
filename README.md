Image Filtering – Gaussian blur, edge detection (Sobel).  Image Enhancement – histogram equalization, sharpening filters.  Morphological Operations – erosion, dilation, compound.  Pattern Detection – template matching, blob detection.  Integration with Deep Learning – combining OpenCV preprocessing with CNN pipeline for classification tasks.
